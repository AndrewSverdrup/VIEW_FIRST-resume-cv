### Java Swing Calendar GUI
I led a team of 4 in the development of a desktop calendar application using Java and Swing.  We created a nice GUI designed for a Mac computer.  Since we used Java, it runs on Windows and Linux as well, but doesn't look as good.  It can be difficult to add events, as the 'Add event' screen expects data in the same format that it is stored in the SQLite database.

Here's a picture of the main screen:
